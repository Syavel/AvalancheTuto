 This is our submission for the "Staking derivatives" subject in the Avalanche tutorials contests.
 Our project will be divided into 3 parts.
 
 - Front-end
 - Back-end
 - Smart Contracts
 - Tutorial
 
The chosen staking derivative is called "liquid staking".
This solution is very profitable for the Avalanche network as it incentivize users to stake their assets, while being able to trade them which is otherwise not possible by simply delegating his $AVAX.

###Front-end

###Back-end

The back-end will call the smart contract functions as well as doing the cross-chain transfer of the "Owner wallet" and stake the exact same amount of $AVAX that were staked by the user.

###Smart Contracts

The smart contract will be used to lock the funds and provide the staked ERC20 tokens to the users.
When the staking period is finished, the user will have to redeem his $AVAX in exchange for $sAVAX.
